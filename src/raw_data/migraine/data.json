It is the generic version of Imigran, and like Imigran it contains the active ingredient sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan belongs to a class of medications known as triptans. Triptans are different to painkilling medications, as they work to reverse the changes in the brain that are thought to induce a migraine attack. They also work to alleviate the symptoms associated with a migraine.", "Imigran is the branded version of the generic medicine Sumatriptan. Generic medicines are medically equivalent to their branded version but are available at a lower price.", "Sumatriptan succinate is thought to reverse the temporary widening of blood vessels in the brain. The widening of these blood vessels is thought to contribute to a migraine attack.

You should only take a second dose if the first dose was at least somewhat effective, but it did not completely relieve your migraine symptoms or your headache came back. You should not take a second Sumatriptan dose if the first dose did not work, but you can try taking Sumatriptan again for a future migraine.", "There is the potential for all medications to cause side effects. However, the particular side effects experienced will vary from person to person. Sumatriptan is safe and effective for the majority of people who are eligible for treatment with it. Some common side effects that may be associated with Sumatriptan can include nausea, vomiting, tiredness/drowsiness, or dizziness. These side effects affect less than 1 in 10 people. If you have any concerns about side effects, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist.", "A medication overuse headache, or a rebound headache, can be caused by the overuse of the drugs used to treat migraines.
