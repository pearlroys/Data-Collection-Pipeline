Sumatriptan belongs to a class of medications known as triptans. Triptans are different to painkilling medications, as they work to reverse the changes in the brain that are thought to induce a migraine attack. They also work to alleviate the symptoms associated with a migraine.', 'Imigran is the branded version of the generic medicine Sumatriptan. Generic medicines are medically equivalent to their branded version but are available at a lower price.', 'Sumatriptan succinate is thought to reverse the temporary widening of blood vessels in the brain. The widening of these blood vessels is thought to contribute to a migraine attack. By stimulating receptors called serotonin (or 5HT) receptors found in the brain and therefore contracting the blood vessels, sumatriptan succinate works to treat the cause of a migraine, as well as helping to reduce any associated symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light or sound.', 'Sumatriptan should be used when simple analgesics such as paracetamol, aspirin, ibuprofen or these simple analgesics combined with codeine are not effective. Sumatriptan can be used by people who experience less than 10 episodes of migraine each month. Sumatriptan should be taken at the beginning of a migraine, but it should not be taken to prevent a migraine, rather only to treat one.', 'It does not matter if you take Sumatriptan with or without food. Take Sumatriptan with some water. One dose of Sumatriptan should be taken at the beginning of migraine onset. Wait for at least two hours after the first dose before taking a second dose. You should only take a second dose if the first dose was at least somewhat effective, but it did not completely relieve your migraine symptoms or your headache came back. You should not take a second Sumatriptan dose if the first dose did not work, but you can try taking Sumatriptan again for a future migraine.', 'There is the potential for all medications to cause side effects. However, the particular side effects experienced will vary from person to person. Sumatriptan is safe and effective for the majority of people who are eligible for treatment with it. Some common side effects that may be associated with Sumatriptan can include nausea, vomiting, tiredness/drowsiness, or dizziness. These side effects affect less than 1 in 10 people. If you have any concerns about side effects, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist.', 'A medication overuse headache, or a rebound headache, can be caused by the overuse of the drugs used to treat migraines. This is why it is very important that you speak to your doctor if you need to take more than 10 doses of Sumatriptan tablets in a month. Your doctor may instead need to discuss prescribing you preventative medication that you can take regularly to help prevent migraines.'] \n",
